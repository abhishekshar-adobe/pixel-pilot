# Design-to-Code Comparison Feature

## Overview
This feature compares live website implementation against Figma design specifications by extracting DOM data during BackstopJS test runs and comparing it with design tokens from Figma API.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. BackstopJS Integration
- Extend existing onReady scripts to extract DOM data
- Capture CSS properties: fonts, sizes, spacing, colors
- Store extracted data alongside screenshots

### 2. DOM Data Extraction
- Font families, weights, sizes
- Element dimensions (width, height, margins, padding)
- Color values (text, background, borders)
- Positioning and layout properties

### 3. Figma API Integration
- Fetch design specs from Figma files
- Extract design tokens and component specifications
- Map Figma elements to DOM selectors

### 4. Comparison Engine
- Compare extracted DOM data with Figma specs
- Identify mismatches with tolerance thresholds
- Generate detailed reports with element-specific issues

### 5. Reporting
- Element-level mismatch reports
- Visual diff highlighting
- Actionable recommendations for developers

## Benefits
- Automated design QA
- Faster design-to-development feedback
- Consistent implementation of design systems
- Reduced manual design review time
